# dsci-100-project_
 [Mayâ€“June 2024] 
[Project Description]
I conducted a data analysis project using R to build a binary classification model that predicts the presence of heart disease. Using the UCI Heart Disease dataset, I examined how factors such as age, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, and resting blood pressure contribute to prediction. The project involved data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. I trained and compared multiple models, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forest. I evaluated each model based on confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. The project also included discussion on model interpretability, limitations, and potential for future improvement.

[Technologies Used]

R (tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, caret, class, rpart, randomForest)

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)

Data visualization (scatter plots, histograms, facet grids)

Model building (logistic regression, k-NN, decision trees, random forest)

Model evaluation (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)

Hypothesis testing, analysis, and proposal of further research directions
