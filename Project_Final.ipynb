    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease is such a common disease that it could cause many problems. Early prediction is the key to preventing it from killing people. Thinking of a way to predict the disease is one of the most important things we should be doing. A dataset from UCI has summarized the 13 important attributes that could be used for predicting heart diseases in four locations: Switzerland, Hungary, Va Long Beach, and Cleveland. It also shows what the heart conditions it has out of 4 severity. \n",

    "\n",
    "The following information will be used for the answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predictive Question: To what extent do age, cholesterol level, Resting Blood Pressure, and Maximum Heart Rate help us create a predictive classifer for the diagnosis of heart rate? \n",
    "\n",
    "The intention of this question is to see if these relatively easily accessible data could predict the presence of heart disease. This would be helpful for people to know; thus, if this parameter do form a good classifier, it would help a lot of people and regions in the world.There are regions in the world that do not have access to high-quality data. Thus, it would be helpful to have a classifier that only uses easy access variables. \n",

    "- Age: Age of the patient (years).\n",
    "- Sex: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female).\n",
    "- CP (Chest Pain Type)\n",
    "- Trestbps (Resting Blood Pressure): Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) \n",
    "- Chol (Serum Cholesterol): Serum cholesterol level (mg/dl).\n",
    "- Fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl):  (1 = true, 0 = false).\n",
    "- Restecg (Resting Electrocardiographic Results): Results of the resting electrocardiogram \n",
    "- Exang (Exercise-Induced Angina): Whether exercise-induced angina\n",

    "- Slope (Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment): Slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "- Ca (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy): Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.\n",
    "- Thal: Thalassemia \n",
    "- Num: Diagnosis of heart disease (0 = no disease, 1-4 = presence of disease with increasing severity).\n",

    "## Expectation\n",
    "We would not have the best result as the data used is easily accessible and has smaller details than some. However, some factors, such as cholesterol and heart rate, are known to be very important. Thus, we could expect the model to have a relevant accuracy of around 70%. \n",
    "It is predicted that age is a significant variable in determining whether a patient has heart disease or not. As age increases, the heart rate also increases. \n",
    "For cholesterol and blood pressure, we expect them to have a positive correlation with age. As age increases, the number of heart diseases increases. Moreover, I expect maximum heart rate to have a negative correlation in relation to age and heart disease to increase as age increases. "

The only difference between these two variables is the color of the plots, with one showing how the actual test data's trend for heart disease diagnosis looks versus the color of the prediction.

    "\n",
    "#### Summarize what you found\n",
    "The model's accuracy is 64.47%, meaning it correctly predicts heart disease in about 64.47% of cases.\n",
    "The precision is 67%, indicating that when the model predicts heart disease, it is correct 66.7% of the time.\n",
    "The recall is 45%, showing that the model only identifies 45% of actual heart disease cases as not being good enough for a heart disease model. \n",
    "The scatter plots visualize the relationship between age and various health metrics (cholesterol, maximum heart rate, and resting blood pressure). From this, we found out the level of pressure does not heavily affect the presence of heart disease, as shown in the scatter plot. It shows how people with lower pressure has heart disease in the similar amount to the ones with hight resting blood pressure. It also showed a weak correlation between Resting Blood Pressure and age and the points spread apart. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discuss whether this is what you expected to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incidence of heart disease was expected to increase with age. The scatter plot shows that the older the person, the higher the incidence of heart disease. This was what we expected to find. However, the model created could not predict this. Although age positively correlated with resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels, this did not affect the presence of heart disease, and the model could not distinguish individuals' presence of heart disease. It was unexpected that the resting Blood pressure did not give us useful information to distinguish whether a person has a heart disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the model's accuracy, we expected an accuracy of approximately 70%. The actual KNN model fell short at 65%. However, it is close to what we expected, as the variables that were chosen were easily accessible variables. We expected that these variables were not enough to make the model good enough to predict the presence of heart disease. This was close to our hypothesis, and it matched it to some degree. However, the recall of the model was around 42%. This is not what I expected here. This means that there are many false negatives, which are too low for the model to be good. This is an unexpected value. This indicates the model has to be improved. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discuss what impact such findings could have.\n",
    "The theme of the research is to see if easily accessible parameters can form a good model with high prediction accuracy. The goal is to see if people in different regions who do not have access to high-quality parameters can predict the presence of heart disease. From this point of view, we found out that it is impossible to do this as the recall was about 42%, meaning that there were a lot of false negative predictions when this model was used.\n",
    "This is not a good thing at all. We found this is not possible through age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and maximum heart rate. This is a good step to show that this parameter on its own would not be able to form a good model, as we found out that resting blood pressure is not a good parameter for heart disease prediction. From the findings that we made, we would be able to move on to see if other easily accessible data, such as sex and others, would be able to contribute to making a better prediction model. Moreover, we learned that the model itself has a high amount of false negatives. This leads to the next question of why this is the case. However, it also showed what machine learning is capable of. However, it has an accuracy of 65%. It could be used for some regions because it is better than nothing. It could lead to early detection and prediction of the disease. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Discuss what future questions this could lead to.\n",

    "What other parameter would enhance the accuracy of the model?\n",
